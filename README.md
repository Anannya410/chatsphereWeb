ChatSphere is an innovative AI-powered search engine designed to revolutionize the way users interact with information. Unlike traditional search engines, ChatSphere integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), providing users with the flexibility to choose the AI that best suits their needs for any given query. 

This repository is for the web version of ChatSphere, which plans to use IndexedDB as the database. Additionally, all primary colors are defined in the Tailwind configuration file to maintain design consistency.

**Key Features**:

- **Multiple AI Models**: ChatSphere offers access to a variety of LLMs, each with unique strengths. Whether users need concise answers, detailed explanations, or creative ideas, they can select the model that fits their specific requirements.
  
- **User-Centric Interface**: The search engine is built with a focus on simplicity and usability. The clean and intuitive design ensures that users can easily navigate through options and find the information they need with minimal effort.
  
- **Contextual Understanding**: Leveraging advanced AI capabilities, ChatSphere delivers results that are contextually relevant, helping users get more accurate and useful information quickly.
  
- **Scalable and Extensible**: The architecture of ChatSphere is designed to scale with the evolving needs of users, allowing for easy integration of additional LLMs and other AI tools in the future.

**Vision**:<br> ChatSphere is not just another search engine; it represents a new paradigm in information retrieval. By putting the power of choice in the hands of users, [VedaVerse](https://vedaverse.io) aims to create a personalized search experience that adapts to diverse needs and preferences.
